## 2025-08-09
- Context: MVP ready (OpenCLIP ViT-B/32; FAISS IP; FastAPI). Small demo image set.
- Hypothesis: Text→image retrieval works but needs semantically aligned images to shine.
- Method: Build index; query whale question; inspect similarities.
- Metrics: Top-1 sim ~0.16 on placeholder images → low.
- Findings: With random/placeholder images, scores are weak; model behaves as expected.
- Next: Add semantically relevant images (whales/animals); consider OCR fusion for text-heavy pics.
